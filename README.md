## Sinopsis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Project Course 2 Assignment

Project Course 2 consists of answering six questions. Each question
assignment asks to create a single plot to answer it.

#### Plot 1

> Question 1: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United
> States from 1999 to 2008?

Using the **base** plotting system, make a plot showing the *total*
PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005,
and 2008.

Over the years, the fine particulate matter, the so-called PM2.5, has
decreased from 7.3 million tons to 3.5 million tons, representing a
52.7% reduction.

#### Plot 2

> Question 2: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the
> **Baltimore City**, Maryland (`fips == "24510"`) from 1999 to 2008?

Use the **base** plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

#### Plot 3

Of the four types of sources indicated by the `type` (point, nonpoint,
onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen
decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for **Baltimore City**? Which have
seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the **ggplot2** plotting
system to make a plot answer this question.

#### Plot 4

Across the United States, how have emissions from coal
combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

#### Plot 5

How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in
**Baltimore City**?

#### Plot 6

Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with
emissions from motor vehicle sources in **Los Angeles County**,
California (`fips == "06037"`). Which city has seen greater changes over
time in motor vehicle emissions?
